# Maze-Game

## Game made for AP CS Final Project In Collaboration With Sean Cao

My contribution to the project was the actual graphics and movement of the game, in which I used RayCasting to Render the 3D walls that make up the maze.
Sean created the maze generation algorithm that changes every time a player loads up a new game.
